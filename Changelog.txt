Patmos Toolchain Changelog
==========================

2014-03-05 LLVM 3.4 upgrade, new paasm implementation
-----------------------------------------------------
- Upgraded tool chain to LLVM 3.4
- Only -m options listed in patmos-clang --help-hidden are passed on to patmos-llc, 
  other options must be passed with -Xllc -m.
- Anti-dependency breaker and breaking false dependencies between predicated instructions
  has been temporarily disabled until the implementation will be fixed.
- paasm uses a hand-written lexer and parser now, and features better error messages,
  symbolic expressions, and supports the same opcode mnemonics as pasim uses for printing.

2013-09-03 Libc and Simulator Features
--------------------------------------
- Dropped uart_flush and uart_fflush.
- Added I-cache to simulator, collect memory usage statistics in simulator
- padasm now supports ELF input
- Added pacheck tool to statically check Patmos binaries for common encoding errors

2013-05-23 ISA Revision
-----------------------
- Changed delay slot size for CALL and BRCF from 2 to 3 cycles

2013-04-26 Assembler Bundle Syntax
----------------------------------
- Dropped the double-semicolon separator, using curly brackets for bundles now

2013-04-16 Libc and Simulator Features
--------------------------------------
- Added --freq option to pasim to set the µs/clock tick rate.
- Write the status of the LEDs to stdout when writing to the LED IO address.
- Added uart_flush and uart_fflush to machine/uart.h in newlib. They send a flush
  control command over the UART to flush the output of the simulator.
- Added support for sleep, usleep, nanosleep for patmos-unknown-unknown-elf target.
  The implementation uses the new µs simulator IO (i.e., they depend on the --freq pasim option)

2013-04-15 ISA Revision
-----------------------
- using old encoding for xor, added xor ALUi format
- call instructions must only have exactly two 32bit instructions in the delay slot
- added $ss alias for $s5
- using $s5 for stack memory spill pointer (was s6), using $s6 for stack top pointer
- added sspill with immediate, as well as sens and sspill indirect
- implemented support for IO-mapped cycle-counter and other IO-devices, dropped counter 
  implementation using s7/s8

2013-04-04 ISA Revision
-----------------------
- removed rsub, nop <nr>, bne, pnor from simulator, ISA and compiler
- removed ALUu and all sext/zext and abs instructions from simulator, ISA and compiler

2013-01-17 LLVM/Clang 3.2 update
--------------------------------
- -mfloat-abi=none and -mno-soft-float is no longer supported
- -ccc-host-triple is no longer supported, use -target instead
- Target triple is now 'patmos-unknown-unknown-elf' instead of 'patmos-unknown-elf'
