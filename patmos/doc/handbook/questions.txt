This is a scratchpad to collect questions on Patmos and T-CREST.
The questions shall resolve in improvement of the handbook or
in a FAQ document.

WCET Analysis and Memory Questions:
-----------------------------------

llvm/tools/platin/etc/patmos contains two .pml files. Non of
the two represents the DE2-115 board. What is the difference?
Are those files used somewhere?

Generating a .pml file with platin ....
generates a .pml file with the correct 21 clock cycles latency.
Where are those defaults defined?
What does bloc-size of 8 mean in the method-cache? If it is for
the variable block cache, then it shall be burst size, which is
16 bytes.

What is the meaning of the associativity in the stack cache?
Why is the block size there 4? What does this mean?
Bursts are for all caches the same. It is a property of the
memory system.

What is the tripple good for in platin pml-config? platin accepts
anything that starts with patmos.

Compile Questions:
------------------

When I compile a simple progam just with patmos-clang. Why are
there functions such as __corethread_worker included in the
executable? Where does this come from? I don't think we need
this.

Why are simple arguments to a function stored in the shadow
stack and not the stack cache? Visible with -O0.

Follwing simple code:

int foo(int b, int val) {

  if (b) {
    val = val * 3;
  } else {
    val = val + 4;
  }

  return val;
}

generates some prolog like:

   20bc4:	03 00 00 08                                  	         sres	8
   20bc8:	00 7f f0 08                                  	         sub	$r31 = $r31, 8
   20bcc:	02 c0 0f 00                                  	         sws	[0] = $r30
   20bd0:	02 44 00 30                                  	         mfs	$r2 = $s0
   20bd4:	00 3d f0 00                                  	         mov	$r30 = $r31
   20bd8:	02 c5 e1 80                                  	         swc	[$r30] = $r3
   20bdc:	02 c5 e2 01                                  	         swc	[$r30 + 1] = $r4
   20be0:	02 87 e1 00                                  	         lwc	$r3 = [$r30]


General Questions:
------------------

How and where are the pins of an IO device connected?

Where is the NoC schedule stored?

How can an IO device be added to the multi-core platform?

What is the base address of the stack? Is this defined somewhere?

Where is the list of all assembler instructions (mnemonics)?

How can we define hexadecimal constants in the assembler?

How to define a sequence of words in assembler?

Trouble with IO device magic: everything that does NOT fit into the standard IO devices is very hard to handle. E.g., IO device that is connected to an arbiter (VGA), cache interrupt to IO interrupt. It is hard to see how the IO device mapping works.

How to add IO pins to Patmos without using an IO device? Add them to PatmosIO in connection.scala

How to use a linker script for memory organization (e.g., reserving entries for a frame buffer)?
