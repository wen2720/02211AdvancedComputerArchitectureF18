Model name:  'MPS model' - run #1    
Objective:   Minimize(R0)
 
SUBMITTED
Model size:        3 constraints,       2 variables,            6 non-zeros.
Sets:                                   0 GUB,                  0 SOS.
 
Using DUAL simplex for phase 1 and PRIMAL simplex for phase 2.
The primal and dual simplex pricing strategy set to 'Devex'.
 
 
Optimal solution                   0 after          0 iter.

Excellent numeric accuracy ||*|| = 0

 MEMO: lp_solve version 5.5.0.10 for 32 bit OS, with 64 bit REAL variables.
      In the total iteration count 0, 0 (100.0%) were bound flips.
      There were 0 refactorizations, 0 triggered by time and 0 by density.
       ... on average 0.0 major pivots per refactorization.
      The largest [LUSOL v2.2.1.0] fact(B) had 4 NZ entries, 1.0x largest basis.
      The constraint matrix inf-norm is 210, with a dynamic range of 210.
      Time to load data was 0.001 seconds, presolve used 0.000 seconds,
