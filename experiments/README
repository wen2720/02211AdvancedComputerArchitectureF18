Compiler/Platin/aiT Benchmark and Evaluation framework

* Copy configuration.rb.dist to configuration.rb and adapt accordingly
* Run via 'ruby run.rb' in experiment subdirectories

Experiments:

* cfrg: experiments with CFRGs (tests all of platin the toolchain, including SWEET) [LCTES13]
* integration: experiments with LLVM/aiT integration [COMPUTING13]
* wcet: standard compiler/wcet calculation tests
* stackcache: runs stackcache related analyses in LLVM and Platin
