# Experiment icache_classify
Goal: classify benchmarks according to their (set-associative) instruction cache behavior (either using the simulator or platin)

## Goal
In particular, we are interested in
* The total number of instruction memory used by the benchmark (with and without compiler runtime functions (softfloats))
* The performance relative to a very large (=ideal) cache, for different cache sizes
* The cache size where the cache achieves 95% (99%) percent of the performance of an ideal cache
